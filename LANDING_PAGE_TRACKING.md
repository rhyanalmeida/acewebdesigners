# Landing Page Tracking Setup for Facebook Pixel

## Summary
Your Facebook Pixel tracking is now fully configured for the `/landing` page with conversion tracking for Calendly bookings.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Facebook Pixel Base Code
- **Location**: `index.html` (lines 63-83)
- **Pixel ID**: `1703925480259996`
- Loads on every page, including the landing page
- Automatically tracks `PageView` events

### 2. Landing Page Specific Tracking
- **Location**: `src/Landing.tsx`
- Fires a custom event `LandingPageView` when users visit `/landing`
- Includes:
  - `page_path: '/landing'`
  - `page_source: 'ad_click'`
  - `content_name: 'Landing Page'`

### 3. Calendly Booking Tracking
- **Location**: `index.html` (lines 85-109)
- Automatically tracks when users complete a Calendly booking
- Fires TWO events:
  - `CompleteRegistration` - Marked as conversion in Facebook Ads
  - `Lead` - Tracks qualified leads

### 4. Test Function
You can test the tracking anytime by opening the browser console and running:
```javascript
testFacebookPixel()
```

This will fire:
- PageView event
- CompleteRegistration event
- Lead event
- Custom LandingPageView event

## Events Tracked on Landing Page

| Event Name | When It Fires | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `PageView` | Every page load | Standard Facebook Pixel event |
| `LandingPageView` | Landing page visit | Custom event for ad landing |
| `CompleteRegistration` | Calendly booking completion | Main conversion event |
| `Lead` | Calendly booking completion | Lead tracking |

## How to Verify It's Working

### Step 1: Check Browser Console
1. Visit your live site: https://acewebdesigners.com
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these messages:
   - `ðŸ“Š Landing page loaded - Facebook Pixel ID: 1703925480259996`
   - `âœ… Landing page custom event tracked`
   - `ðŸ§ª Facebook Pixel loaded successfully`

### Step 2: Check Facebook Events Manager
1. Go to https://business.facebook.com/events_manager
2. Select your Pixel (ID: 1703925480259996)
3. In the "Test Events" tab, perform these actions:
   - Visit the landing page
   - Run `testFacebookPixel()` in console
   - Complete a test Calendly booking
4. You should see events appearing in real-time

### Step 3: Create Facebook Custom Conversions
1. In Events Manager, go to "Datasets" â†’ "Custom Conversions"
2. Create a custom conversion for:
   - **Event**: `CompleteRegistration`
   - **URL**: Contains `/landing`
   - **Value**: When booking completed

## Current Deployment
- âœ… Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- âœ… Netlify will auto-deploy from master branch
- ðŸ”„ Wait for deployment to complete (check Netlify dashboard)

## Troubleshooting

### Pixel Not Detected
If Facebook says "A pixel wasn't detected":
1. Wait 24-48 hours after deployment (Facebook needs to crawl)
2. Try the Test Events tool in Events Manager
3. Check browser console for errors

### Events Not Firing
1. Open browser console on your site
2. Run `testFacebookPixel()` to manually fire events
3. Check if `window.fbq` exists: type `window.fbq` in console
4. Look for console errors

### Common Issues
- **Ad blocker**: Disable extensions that block tracking
- **Privacy settings**: Some browsers block third-party scripts
- **Cache**: Clear browser cache and try again

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Wait for Netlify deployment to complete
2. âœ… Test on live site with browser console open
3. âœ… Verify events in Facebook Events Manager
4. âœ… Complete a test Calendly booking to confirm conversion tracking
5. âœ… Set up Facebook Custom Conversions for your ad campaigns

## Support
If events still aren't working after 24 hours:
1. Check Netlify deployment logs
2. Verify the pixel code is in the live HTML
3. Contact Facebook support with your Pixel ID: `1703925480259996`
